        Summary:
        Kotlin doesnâ€™t define its own collection classes and instead extends the Java collection
        classes with a richer API.
        Defining default values for function parameters greatly reduces the need to define
        overloaded functions, and the named-argument syntax makes calls to functions with
        many parameters much more readable.
        Functions and properties can be declared directly in a file, not just as members of a class,
        allowing for a more flexible code structure.
        Extension functions and properties let you extend the API of any class, including classes
        defined in external libraries, without modifying its source code and with no runtime
        overhead.
        Infix calls provide a clean syntax for calling operator-like methods with a single
        argument.
        Kotlin provides a large number of convenient string-handling functions for both regular
        expressions and plain strings.
        Triple-quoted strings provide a clean way to write expressions that would require a lot of
        noisy escaping and string concatenation in Java.
        Local functions help you structure your code more cleanly and eliminate duplication.
